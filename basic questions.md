# Basic questions for every interview

The goal of the interview is not only to learn about the technical skills of a candidate but also to get to know them in a different light.

To do that, you can ask them specific questions. They are open ones, there is just no right answer, but with them, you can have a better idea of how they behave in a team.

1. When did you start programming and why? (ignore this for management positions)
2. What was your biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?
3. If you had to choose between having a project with only you or working with a group, which one would you prefer?
4. Could you tell me about a time where you received a bad feedback and how you approached it?
5. Which technologies do you have experience with and what are your thoughts on working with technologies outside of the one you are applying for?
