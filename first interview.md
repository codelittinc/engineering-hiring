# First interview

If this is your first interview you need to prepare yourself properly. I recommend the following steps:

1. Go back and finish reading the [README.md](https://github.com/codelittinc/engineering-hiring/blob/master/README.md#foreword). There
we provide a information about how to prepare and considerations.
2. Go through the [example interview](https://github.com/codelittinc/engineering-hiring/blob/master/interview%20flow.md#interview-example)
there you will see how Kaio does his technical interviews. If later on you have suggestions on how to improve it
please submit your them!
