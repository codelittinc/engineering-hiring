# Foreword

For the interviewer the goal of any job interview is to answer the question:

_Is this person that I am talking to a good fit for the team?_

To evaluate the candidate's skills, to gauge his knowledge and to know what drives him is not the goal, but just ways of achieving it.

As an interviewer, you are looking for someone that will work side by side with you for the next foreseeable future. This person is going to be the one that you will trust to make decisions for you, ones that will impact your life in a lot of different ways. 

If you ever have worked in a team, you know that when one person takes a bad decision, the entire team suffers, so based on your requirements you need to assure that the person you are talking to is the one you want to have your back.

## Hiring process

The Engineering Department hiring process is composed of four phases:

1. Meeting interview
2. Exercise
3. Knowledge verification interview
4. General considerations

Our goal is to have the four steps in two weeks.

### 1. Meeting interview

This is the first interview, and it doesn't need to be made by an engineer, it can be made by an experienced member of the HR team. During this phase we want to know the person better, we want to see if he is a team player, if he prefers books or movies, if he is more like an engineer or a leader. If he likes to dance or to fight ( why not both? ). This is a culture fit interview, and you are trying to discover if this is a person that you would like to work with.

Since this is the first interview remember that you are being interviewed as well. The person on the other side wants to know if Codelitt is the place she wants to spend the next days of her life.

### Interview flow example:

```
1. - Hi, my name is Peter, and I'm an engineer at Codelitt. I am responsible for this first interview with you. 
2. Explain what we do
3. Ask if he has any questions and answer them
4. Explain the hiring process and each step
5. Ask if he has any questions and answer them
6. Ask your questions
7. Ask if he has any questions and answer them
8. Explain that his application will be discussed internally and you will get back to him with the news about the result and the next steps.
```

#### Questions you need to be prepared to answer:

1. What we do
2. Who we are
3. How we communicate
4. How many we are
5. What kind of projects do we work with?
6. How does a general day look like?
7. What do you love at Codelitt
8. How long the hiring process takes?


#### Questions to make

1. When did you start programming and why?
2. What was the last book you read? What do you like to learn?
3. What was the latest technology you learned and when?
4. What was your biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?
5. Did you ever work on a remote team?
6. If you had to choose between having a project with only you or working with a group, which one would you prefer?
7. Did you ever a mentor? What did you learn from him that you would like to share?
8. Have you ever been someone's mentor? What is the most critical topic you ever taught?
9. What do you think about receiving feedbacks?

As you may notice none of these questions are technical ones and all of them are open ones. There is just no right answer, but with them, you can have a bare idea of how he behaves in a team.

#### Red flags

1. He started programming too recent, but bear in mind that it is relative with the expectations for the position. You can't have a senior with only two years of experience, but you can have a junior with ten years.
2. Can't remember the last book
3. No big challenge or can't explain how he solved it
4. If the person never worked with remote teams, you want to pay some attention in how he communicates. Is it easier to understand?
5. If you are looking for a leadership position, you will want someone who would prefer to work with a team
6. If you are looking for a leadership position, you will want someone who mentored before.
7. Doesn't like feedbacks
8. The last technology he learned was too long ago

#### Action items:

If he is a good fit for the next step:

Go to The next step

If he isn't a good fit:
Send him an email explaining that we decided not to move forward with his application, but if any position opens we will be reaching out to him.

### 2. Exercise

At this point, you believe that the candidate is someone you would like to work with and now you start gauging his knowledge. The goal of this phase is to see if the candidate:

1. Has enough experience to create a basic application from scratch
2. Understands the stack and how to work with it
3. Values good practices and applies them

#### Choosing the exercise:

Based on the stack of the position you are interviewing for, choose an exercise based on THIS LIST and send it to the candidate. If an exercise for the stack in case is not there, please create one and ask your teammates to review it before sending.


#### Sharing the exercise:

1. Create a gitlab repository under our Codelitt account for the candidate.
2. Commit the exercise in the README.md of the project
3. Share with the candidate's email

Usually, we give four days for the person to submit the exercise. Bear in mind that the candidate may already have another job and already has its schedules. Explain to him that he has four days to finish it, but if for any reason it is not enough then the candidate should send you an email just to let you know that you should expect a solution by when.

#### Action items:

If you received the exercise, you need to review it and gather another engineer to consider it as well without sharing your thoughts. After you two have it examined get together and discuss if you want to work with him.

#### Red flags:

1. The candidate didn't send the exercise and didn't notify you about it
2. The exercise result doesn't apply basic code quality principles 
3. The exercise doesn't work as expected


### 3. Knowledge verification interview

The exercise gave you some insight of what kind of decisions he takes, now it is time to confirm what he may know that is interesting to you. Before you jump into this interview, please grab the stack's specific questions and the generic ones. You will fist a list with the ones we have >>>>here<<<, if you can't find for the stack you need, please talk to your manager.

#### Interview flow example:
```
1. - Hey Diogo, thanks for taking the time to complete this exercise
2. - The goal of this interview is to go through what you did on your exercise and to go through a few technical questions
3. - This is the third of four steps hiring process, we deciding to move forward with your application, the next step will be an interview with our COO to discuss a few details of the position.
4. - Do you have any question?
5. Start the project question
6. - Do you have any question?
7. Start the stack questions
8. - Do you have any question?
9. - We will discuss your application internally and will reach out to you soon.
```

### 4. General considerations

The COO specifically handles this step.
