# Engineering Hiring Guidelines

## Foreword

For the interviewer the goal of any job interview is to answer the question:

_Is this person that I am talking to a good fit for the team?_

Evaluating the candidate's skills, knowledge and what drives them is not the goal. Instead, we need to closely evaluate how the candidate approaches achieving their goals.

As an interviewer, you are looking for someone that will work side by side with you for the foreseeable future. This person is going to be the one that you will trust to make decisions for you, ones that will impact your life in a lot of different ways.

If you have ever worked in a team, you know that when one person makes a bad decision, the entire team suffers. So, based on your requirements you need to assure that the person you are talking to is the one you want to have your back.

## Hiring process

The Engineering Department hiring process is composed of four phases:

1. Meeting interview
2. Exercise
3. Knowledge verification interview
4. General considerations

Our goal is to have the four steps completed in two weeks, in an ideal scenario.

### 1. Meeting interview

This is the first interview, and it doesn't need to be conducted by an engineer, it can be run by an experienced member of the HR team. During this phase we want to learn more about the person, we want to see if they're a team player, if they prefer books or movies, if they're more like an engineer or a leader. If they like to dance or to fight (why not both?). This is a culture fit interview, and you are trying to discover if this is a person that you would like to work with.

Since this is the first interview remember that you are being interviewed as well. The person on the other side wants to know if Codelitt is the place they want to spend the next days of their life.

#### Interview flow example

1. Introduce yourself: _Hi, my name is Peter, and I'm an engineer at Codelitt. I am responsible for this first interview with you._
2. Explain what we do
3. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
4. Explain the hiring process and each step
5. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
6. Ask your questions
7. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
8. Explain that their application will be discussed internally and you will get back to them with the news about the result and the next steps.

#### Questions you need to be prepared to answer

1. What we do
2. Who we are
3. How we communicate
4. How many we are
5. What kind of projects do we work with?
6. What does a general day look like?
7. What do you love about Codelitt
8. How long does the hiring process take?

#### Questions to make

The goal of the interview is not only to learn about the technical skills of a candidate but also to get to know them in a different light.

To do that, you can ask them specific questions. They are open ones, there is just no right answer, but with them, you can have a better idea of how they behave in a team.

1. When did you start programming and why?
2. What was the last book you read? What do you like to learn?
3. What was the latest technology you learned and when?
4. What was your biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?
5. Have you ever worked on a remote team?
6. If you had to choose between having a project with only you or working with a group, which one would you prefer?
7. Have you ever had a mentor? What did you learn from him or her that you would like to share?
8. Have you ever been someone's mentor? What is the most critical topic you ever taught?
9. What do you think about receiving feedback?

#### Red flags

Depending on how the candidate answers the questions above, the following are some potential concerns to look out for.

1. Started programming too recently, but bear in mind that it is relative with the expectations for the position. You can't have a senior with only two years of experience, but you can have a junior with ten years.
2. Can't remember the last book.
3. English is not fluent.
4. Never faced a big challenge or can't explain how they solved it.
5. Never worked with remote teams. You want to pay some attention in how they communicate. Are they easy to understand?
6. If you are looking for a leadership position, you will want someone who would prefers to work with a team.
7. If you are looking for a leadership position, you will want someone who has been a mentor in the past.
8. Doesn't like receiving feedback.
9. The last technology they learned was too long ago.

#### Action items

Is the candidate a good fit for the next step?
- **Yes**: go to the next step.
- **No**: send them an email explaining that we decided not to move forward with their application, but if any position opens we will be reaching out to them.

### 2. Exercise

At this point, you believe that the candidate is someone you would like to work with and now you start gauging their knowledge. The goal of this phase is to see if the candidate:

1. Has enough experience to create a basic application from scratch
2. Understands the stack and how to work with it
3. Values good practices and applies them

#### Choosing the exercise

Based on the stack of the position you are interviewing for, choose an exercise based on this list and send it to the candidate. If an exercise for the stack is not there, please create one and ask your teammates to review it before sending.

**TODO: add the exercises list**

#### Sharing the exercise

1. Create a GitLab repository under [our Codelitt account](https://gitlab.com/codelittinc) for the candidate.
2. Commit the exercise in the README.md of the project
3. Share with the candidate's email

Usually, we give four days for the person to submit the exercise. Bear in mind that the candidate may already have another job. Explain to them that they have four days to finish it, but if for any reason it is not enough then the candidate should send you an email just to let you know that you should expect a solution by when.

#### Action items

If you received the exercise, you need to review it and gather another engineer to consider it as well without sharing your thoughts. After you two have it examined get together and discuss if you want to work with the candidate.

#### Red flags

1. The candidate didn't send the exercise and didn't notify you about it
2. The exercise result doesn't apply basic code quality principles
3. The exercise doesn't work as expected

### 3. Knowledge verification interview

The exercise gave you some insight of what kind of decisions they take, now it is time to confirm what they may know that is interesting to you. Before you jump into this interview, please grab the stack's specific questions and the generic ones. You will find a list with the ones we have >>>>here<<<, if you can't find exercises for the stack you need, please talk to your manager.

#### Interview flow example

1. _Hey Diogo, thanks for taking the time to complete this exercise_
2. Explain the purpose of this interview: _the goal of this interview is to go through what you did on your exercise and to go through a few technical questions._
3. Explain which step we are in: _this is the third of four steps hiring process, we deciding to move forward with your application, the next step will be an interview with our COO to discuss a few details of the position._
4. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
5. Start the project questions
6. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
7. Start the stack questions
8. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
9. End the interview: _we will discuss your application internally and will reach out to you soon._

### 4. General considerations

The COO specifically handles this step.
