# Engineering Hiring Guidelines

## Foreword

The goal of any interviewer during a job interview is to answer the following question:

_Is this person a good fit for this position?_

Your goal is to evaluate the candidate's skills, knowledge and what drives them.  As an interviewer, you are looking for someone that will work side by side with your team for the foreseeable future. This person is going to be the one that you will trust to make decisions for you, ones that will impact your life in many ways.

You know that when one person makes a bad decision, the entire team suffers. So, based on your requirements you need to assure that the person you are talking to is the one you want to have your back.

### Considerations

1. The candidate is under an imense pressure, to be in a hiring process is usually a stressful experienc. Be nice and welcoming.
2. Most candidates are more comfortable speaking with you when your webcam is turned on. It happens because the person on the other side can see how you react and they can make sure they are speaking with a human, instead of a picture; thus is highly recommended to have the interviews with your webcam tuned on.
    1. If you have your camera on, you should assure that you are well dressed and that the candidate has a clear view.
    2. Show the candidate you are listening by making head nods or small sounds like 'uhum'
    3. Sometimes the candidate may keep going if you don't redirect him to another question. Interrupt the candidate when necessary to guarantee you can continue with the interview.

#### What if a candidate asks me something I don't know?

Often the candidates can throw you offguard by asking a question you don't have an answer for, in cases like that just be honest and tell you don't know _yet_, but that you will get the answer and send to the candidate via email. Also, make sure to get the information and don't forget to send that after the call ends.

### Red flags

Depending on how the candidate answers the questions above, the following are some potential concerns to look out for.

1. Started programming too recently, but bear in mind that it is relative with the expectations for the position. You can't have a senior with only two years of experience, but you can have a junior with ten years.
3. English is not fluent.
