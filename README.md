# Engineering Hiring Guidelines

## Foreword

For the interviewer the goal of any job interview is to answer the question:

_Is this person that I am talking to a good fit for the team?_

Evaluating the candidate's skills, knowledge and what drives them is not the goal. Instead, we need to determine how the candidate approaches achieving their goals closely.

As an interviewer, you are looking for someone that will work side by side with you for the foreseeable future. This person is going to be the one that you will trust to make decisions for you, ones that will impact your life in a lot of different ways.

If you have ever worked in a team, you know that when one person makes a bad decision, the entire team suffers. So, based on your requirements you need to assure that the person you are talking to is the one you want to have your back.

## How to prepare yourself for the interview

Before the first interview make sure that:

1. You know for which position you're interviewing for, this is important because it should guide the level of questions and expectations you should have towards the candidate.
2. The candidate fits into the position you're interviewing for. If you are looking for a senior and the candidate only has two years of experience you should recognize it as a huge red flag.
3. You have the [questions for the stack requested](https://github.com/codelittinc/engineering-hiring/tree/master/questions).

Things to have in mind:

1. The candidate is under huge pressure, to be interviewed is usually a stressful experience, mainly because most people don't like to be evaluated by someone they just meet, thus try to be nice.
2. Most candidates are more comfortable speaking with you when your webcam is turned on. It happens because the person on the other side can see how you react and they can make sure they are speaking with a human, and not with a picture; thus is highly recommended to have the interviews with your webcam tuned on.
    1. If you have your camera turned on you should make sure that you are well dressed and that the candidate has a clear view. If you were being interviewed by a guy that was apparently in a kitchen, I doubt you would be able to take him seriously.
    2. When you ask something don't let the candidate speak over and over without making a noise, you don't need to interrupt him to send signals that you are understanding and following. Sometimes a `hum` is enough.

## 1. Meeting interview

This is the first interview, and it doesn't need to be conducted by an engineer, it can be run by an experienced member of the HR team. During this phase we want to learn more about the person, we want to see if they're a team player, if they prefer books or movies, if they're more like an engineer or a leader, If they like to dance or to fight (why not both?). This is a culture fit interview, and you are trying to discover if this is a person that you would like to work with.

### Interview flow example

1. Introduce yourself: _Hi, my name is Peter, and I'm an engineer at Codelitt. I am responsible for this first interview with you._
2. Explain what we do
3. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
4. Explain the hiring process and each step
5. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
6. Ask your questions
7. Ask if he or she has any questions and answer them
8. Explain that their application will be discussed internally and you will get back to them with the news about the result and the next steps.

### Questions you need to be prepared to answer

Since this is the first interview remember that you are being interviewed as well. The person on the other side wants to know if Codelitt is the place they want to spend the next days of their life.

1. What is Codelitt and what it does?
3. How do you communicate?
4. How many are you?
5. What kind of projects does Codelitt work with?
6. What does a general day look like?
7. What do you love about Codelitt?
8. How long does the hiring process take?
9. Can you tell me more about the project I am supposed to work on?

#### What if a candidate asks me something I don't know?

There might be a rare case in which you are not prepared to answer any question. For example, you might have not enough information regarding the project the candidate is supposed to jump in. The goal in dealing with this situation is to answer them without giving the feel of a lacking organization. Never say _I don't know_!

In most of the cases, you can take advantage of the fact that this is the first step, and answer with something like _unfortunately at this point I can’t provide you such information_. If you think their question requires research to be responded appropriately, you can say: _we’re going to discuss it internally and let you know via email_.

### Questions to make

The goal of the interview is not only to learn about the technical skills of a candidate but also to get to know them in a different light.

To do that, you can ask them specific questions. They are open ones, there is just no right answer, but with them, you can have a better idea of how they behave in a team.

1. When did you start programming and why?
2. What was the last book you read? What do you like to learn?
3. What was the latest technology you learned and when?
4. What was your biggest challenge and how did you overcome it?
5. Have you ever worked on a remote team?
6. If you had to choose between having a project with only you or working with a group, which one would you prefer?
7. Have you ever had a mentor? What did you learn from him or her that you would like to share?
8. Have you ever been someone's mentor? What is the most critical topic you ever taught?
9. What do you think about receiving feedback?

Bear in mind that you might want to consider the aptitude a candidate has to grow. Questions like _“What was the latest technology you learned and when?“_ or _“Do you have or had personal projects? Or collaborate in open source ones?“_ can give you an idea about the effort he or she put in the professional life. Depending on the reason why you’re hiring, it might be worth picking someone with poor experience but good aptitude to learn, rather than an experienced developer who is still using Java since they completed their degree.

### Red flags

Depending on how the candidate answers the questions above, the following are some potential concerns to look out for.

1. Started programming too recently, but bear in mind that it is relative with the expectations for the position. You can't have a senior with only two years of experience, but you can have a junior with ten years.
2. Can't remember the last book.
3. English is not fluent.
4. Never faced a big challenge or can't explain how they solved it.
5. Never worked with remote teams. You want to pay some attention to how they communicate. Are they easy to understand?
6. If you are looking for a leadership position, you will want someone who would prefer to work with a team.
7. If you are looking for a leadership position, you will want someone who has been a mentor in the past.
8. Doesn't like receiving feedback.
9. The last technology they learned was too long ago. This also depends on the technology, but it's mainly to see if the candidate likes to be up to date with the development world, or if it's just something they study passively.
