discussing software engineering. During this process feel free to interrupt me if you have any questions, remember that you are interviewing us as well._
3. Here at Codelitt we build products. We work with companies of all sizes, from startups with one people to big corporations with more than 98 thousand employees. What they have in common
is their lack of ability or capacity to build software products. To help them with that we have Software Engineers, Project Managers, Product Owners, Designers, and UI/UX Researches. We pride ourselves into building products for people, our goal is to make delightful experiences. We work with both client products and our internal ones as well. We are the owners of [Rolli](https://rolliapp.com/) which is a product that helps experts to appear on Podcasts or TV Shows and [Convox](https://convox.com/) which is a deployment tool that allows any engineer to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster without knowing kubernetes. About our work style. We have been a remote company from the conception, meaning that we've been working remotely since 2013. We believe that we can get the best people in the world and trust they will do a great job given the resources necessary to do it. We have quite a number of company events through the year, including a remote codelitt conference every september in which we have company presentations, it is a full day party. Codelitt has around 75 people and around 35 engineers, we are so remote that each c-level is in a different Continent. The CTO is in South America, the CDO in Europe and the CEO in North America.
