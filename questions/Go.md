### Overall Thoughts
Go is a language that is meant to be simple and easily picked up by developers with any amount of experience,
overall I suggest focusing more on questions about overall coding then GO specific questions. 
e.g. "What is DRY and why is it useful?"

## Basic Questions
* What are the advantages of GO?
* Explain what is a go routine is? How can you stop a go routine?
* What is the Difference between struct and interface?
* What is concurrency? (Hint: How is it different from parrallelism)
* What is the difference between slices and arrays in Go?
* Are maps safe to use?
* How would you implement your own error type, how would you make it compatible with other errors? 
* How defer work?
* (Check if the candidate follows the evolution of Go) How can you check the type of an Error?
* (Check if the candidate follows the evolution of Go) Is 1_000_000 a valid Go number?
