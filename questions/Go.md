### Overall Thoughts
Go is a language that is meant to be simple and easily picked up by developers with any amount of experience,
overall I suggest focusing more on questions about overall coding then GO specific questions. 
e.g. "What is DRY and why is it useful?"

## Basic Questions
* What are the advantages of GO?
* Explain what is a go routine is? How can you stop a go routine?
* What is the Difference between struct and interface?
