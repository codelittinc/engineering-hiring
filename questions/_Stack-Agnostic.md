# General questions

These are questions which every software engineer must be able to answer.

- Are you familiar with **Git**?
- Are you familiar with the basic bash commands?
- Are you familiar with **Docker**?
- What is the TDD methodology?
- What is the Continuous Integration?
- What is the **MVC** pattern?
- What is the difference between a relational and a non relational database?

# Full-stack

If the candidate is applying for a **full-stack engineer** position, you must ask them one open question. It requires them to pick the potential technology which they hold to be the best for the given purpose.

## 1. List of people app

##### Question:

Let's say you have to build an application to manage a list of people. The user should be able to see the list, and to add, remove and delete a person from it. You are free to choose your favorite language(s), or the one you think it's more appropriate, database and architecture. What approach would you use for doing it?

#### Extra points

- Single stack for both back-end and front-end
- Client-server architecture
- Front-end using React, Angular or Vue
- Focus on security best practices
- Focus on data structure
- Focus on database technology
- Consider data validation
- Consider design and user experience
- Consider the possibility the project will increase its size

#### Red flags

- Not considering a SPA (Single Page Application)
- Choose obsolete technologies (for example, anything which runs on Tomcat)
- Pick a monolithic architecture
- Can't explain the reason of the chosen stack
- Takes too long to provide a solution

# Back-End

The following questions can be asked to candidates who are applying for either a **full-stack** or a **back-end engineer** position. They are organized by difficulty, so depending on the candidate's experience you might want to ask some basic or some advanced questions.

# Front-End

The following questions can be asked to candidates who are applying for either a **full-stack** or a **front-end engineer** position. They are organized by difficulty, so depending on the candidate's experience you might want to ask some basic or some advanced questions.
