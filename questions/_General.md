If the candidate is applying for a **full-stack engineer** position, you must ask them one open question. It requires them to pick the potential technology which they hold to be the best for the given purpose.

### 1. List of people app

##### Question:

Let's say you have to build an application to manage a list of people. The user should be able to see the list, and to add, remove and delete a person from it. You are free to choose your favorite language(s), or the one you think it's more appropriate, database and architecture. What approach would you use for doing it?

#### Extra points

- Client-server architecture
- Front-end using React, Angular or Vue
