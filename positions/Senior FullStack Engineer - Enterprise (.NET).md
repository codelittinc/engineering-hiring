* **What is an ORM and where would you use it?** *MUST*
    * An ORM library is a completely ordinary library written in your language of choice that encapsulates the code needed to manipulate the data, so you don't use SQL anymore; you interact directly with an object in the same language you're using. We would use one when we are connecting to a database.
